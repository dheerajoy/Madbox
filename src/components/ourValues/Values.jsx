                <p>Game making is about exploration and facing uncertainty, together. High ambitions require humility about what we donâ€™t know. That is why we have created an environment where our talents constantly support each other and where passion & learnings are shared.</p>

                    <p>Assessing our ideas through high-speed testing, and receiving feedback as fast and often as we can is paramount at Madbox. Quick failure and iteration is always preferred to long-drawn-out discussions.</p>

                <p>At Madbox, anything should be said as long as it is thoughtfully shared. We believe that the delivery of feedback is as equally important as the message itself. This is our way to build a transparent culture, where everyone participates in both the celebrations and challenges of building a company together.</p>
